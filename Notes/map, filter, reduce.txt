map, filter, reduce

all three of them are array methods.

1.map():

map returns a new array of same size which containes the transformed elements of the given array.

length of the returned array always stays the same as original array.

map returns an array while forEach() doesnt.


2.filter():

filter returns a new array which contains only the filtered elements.

length of the returned array can be equal or less than the original array.

filter returns an array while forEach() doesnt.

the callback we pass to the filter, must return a boolean.


3.reduce():

reduce returns just a value depanding upon the logic. never returns an array.
