sort

sort => rearranging the elements of an array in ascending or descending fashion.

sort mutates the original array.

arr.slice(0).sort() is used to prevent mutation of the original array.

sort converts all the elements of an array into string then sort it.

To sort an array on the basis of numerical order, we need to pass a compare-function to the sort().

if we return a positive number from the compare function, we are asking the order of a and b to be intercahnged.

and if we return a negative number, the order remains the same.

narr.sort((a, b) => a - b) == for ascending order.

narr.sort((a, b) => b - a) == for descending order.
