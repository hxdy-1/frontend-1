bg images 
bg-repeat: no-repeat -
repeat-x -
repeat-y -

bg size: contain - always shows complete image, used when img is more important to show.

bg size: cover - covers the whole element with image and never shows the bg without img, sometimes crops the image.

bg position: X axis value Y axis value (single value defines both axis)

top, bottom, left, right, center, and top(right, left), bottom(right, left)

background: color image bg-repeat position; - shorthand for all bg values (not preferrable).

*pseudo classes*

used to defne a special state for an element.

hover - when we take cursor on the element.

focuse - when we click on element.

visited - for visited elements

active - the time when we click on the element (time span when we hold the mouse button)

.container: not(p) {
	color: white;
}

above code will apply color on all the elements of .container except p.

MDN - a website for docs and advanced concepts.

visited > hover > active - this is the order for applying pseudo classes on links/elements.

specificity wins over cascade.

id = 100, class = 10, normal tag = 1 - specificity of selectors.
