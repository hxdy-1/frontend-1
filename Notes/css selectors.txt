css selectors are used to select/target an element to style.
the three basic types of selectors are: simple, combinator, and attribute selector.
simple selectors are used to select elements on the basis of tag names, ids, classes.
combinator selectors are that who explain the relation between selectors:

1.descendants: for ex. main p {} - where main is parent and p is children of main.

2.immediate children: div > span {} - where div is parent and span is its immediate children.

3.immediate sibling: div + span {} - where div and span are immediate siblings of eachothers

4.genral sibling: div ~ span {} - where div and all span are genral siblings of each other.

attribute selectors: input[any attribute which diffrentiate between alll input] {}

multiple classes and ids selectors: .div1.div2 for class
#div1#div2 for ids
.div1#div2 for both id and classes
