chrome has V8 engine for JS.

js is loosely typed language.

value = piece of data/information.

int age = 30;

where age is a variable (container) and 30 is a value stored in that variable. and int is the data type (type of variable) that is integer.

variables can't be start with a number.
spaces not allowed use underscore or camel case instead.
reserved keywords cant be used as a name.

primitive (numbers, string, boolean, undefined, null, bigint, symbol)
object (var, let, const)

defer = downloads html and js file parallel but execute html first then js file.

prompt recives inputs as string.

string: set of characters 

let firstName = "random";
let birthYear = 2002;
let workStatus = "student"

print: random's age is 23 and he's a student

let age = 2023 - birthYear

console.log(`${firstName}'s age is ${age} and he's a ${student}`)

typecasting:-

number to string:

let age = 20;
console.log(age + " ");

string to number:

let age = "20";
console.log(Number(age));

three ways to declare variables in js:-

var (redeclaration is possible)

var age = 20;
var age = 30;

console.log(age);
> 30


let (cant be re declare)

let age = 20;
let age = 30;

console.log(age);
> Identifier 'age' has already been declared


const (cant be redeclared and reinitilized)

const age = 20;
const age = 30;

console.log(age);
> Identifier 'age' has already been declared
