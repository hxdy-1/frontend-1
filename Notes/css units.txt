css units are classified as Absolute units:px, cm, in etc.
and Relative units:%, vh, vw, rem, etc.

%: it is relative to the parents dimensions.

vh-vw: are viewport based height and width.

em and rem: are relative to the parents font size

1em = 16px by default

disadvantage of em starts to compund across the chidren.

em apply the size acording to its direct parent.

rem apply the size according to the root parent. <html>

whenever we use em on height, width, margin, padding it acts according to the font size of the current element.

font-size: rem, width: % or rem, margin: rem, padding: em, heigth: min/max height. 

by default unit is em which is equivelant to 16px.
