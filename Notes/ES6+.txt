ES6+

Enhanced object litral syntax:

we can add a key value pair just by writing the name of the previously existing variable, function, and obj.

Computed properties:

we can use [] to use template litral to define desired keys in obj.


Object.entries():

returns a 2D array which contains key at 0 index and value at 1 index.


Destructuring:

Array destructuring:
it is an ES6 feature that is used to unpack the elements of an array(object, map, set)into seprate variables.

const arr = [10, 20, [40, 50, 30]]

const [a, b, c] = arr

console.log(a, b, c)

=> 10
   20
   30

nested de-structuring:

const [, obj, [, , x]] = arr



Object destructuring:

const person = {}

name of the new variable must be same to which key its getting assigned to.

order doesn't matter

alias:

const {intelligent: intelligence} = person
