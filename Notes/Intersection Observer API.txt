Intersection Observer API

it is given from the browser

we observe intersection of two elements

Root element (parent)
Target element (child)

Intersection observer API allows our code to observe changes in the intersection of a target element, with an ansector element or the viewport.

It allows us to register a callback function that's executed whenever an element we wish to monitor enters or exits another element (or the viewport). Or when the amount by which the two intersection changes by a requested amount.

root: should mention root element

threshold (ranges from 0 to 1): 0 is for 1px and 1 is for 100% of the targeted element.

rootMargin: gives margin to the root element.


syntax:

const callback = function(entry, observer) {
    if(entry[0].isIntersecting){
    console.log("The target element intersected the root element)
    }

}

const object = {
    root: "",
    threshold: "",
    rootMargin: ""
}

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, object);

observer.observer()
