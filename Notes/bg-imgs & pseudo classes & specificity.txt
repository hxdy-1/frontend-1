bg images 
bg-repeat: no-repeat -
repeat-x -
repeat-y -

bg size: contain - always shows complete image, used when img is more important to show.

bg size: cover - covers the whole element with image and never shows the bg without img, sometimes crops the image.

bg position: X axis value Y axis value (single value defines both axis)

top, bottom, left, right, center, and top(right, left), bottom(right, left)

background: color image bg-repeat position; - shorthand for all bg values (not preferrable).

*pseudo classes*

used to defne a special state for an element.

hover - when we take cursor on the element.

focuse - when we click on element.

visited - for visited elements

active - the time when we click on the element (time span when we hold the mouse button)

.container: not(p) {
	color: white;
}

above code will apply color on all the elements of .container except p.

MDN - a website for docs and advanced concepts.

visited > hover > active - this is the order for applying pseudo classes on links/elements.

*specificity*

specificity wins over cascade.

!important = 10000 (overides over everything)  inline style = 1000, id = 100, class = 10, normal tag = 1 :- specificity of selectors, where !important is a key word to overide inline style. 

*opacity*

it defines the transperacy of an element and ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 is the most opec and 0 is least opec(transparent), by default opacity is 1(not transperent at all). applies on every child element so better use rgba()
opacity 0 just makes the element go invisible while display: none; - deletes the element.

visibility: hidden; - is a mixture of display: none; and opacity: 0; - means it doesn't delete the element while making the hover effect false.
